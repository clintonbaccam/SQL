--For this query here, I am using a query that gets the average of the salary per department, and what each employee makes in each company also. 

Select employee,company,department,salary,
 avg(salary) OVER ( Partition BY department)as total
 FROM Emp
 order by total desc;




--For this query I am ranking each employee by how much salary they all  make. It doesn't matter what their job is or what department. This bascially shows just a general salary. 

Select employee, employee_id,department,salary,
Rank() over(Order by salary)rank
from Emp
