-- I use the data from kaggle to get this data set for employees 
--These sets of query will mostly show my use of CTE and SQL window functions.

--For this query here, I am using a query that gets the average of the salary per department, and what each employee makes in each company also. 

Select employee,company,department,salary,
 avg(salary) OVER ( Partition BY department)as total
 FROM Emp
 order by total desc;




--For this query I am ranking each employee by how much salary they all  make. It doesn't matter what their job is or what department. This bascially shows just a general salary. 
Select employee, employee_id,department,salary,
Rank() over(Order by salary)rank
from Emp


--Ranking employees based off their salary in this documentation
SELECT employee_id,department,salary,
RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary)
FROM Emp;


--Find the difference between the employees salary and the average salary
SELECT employee_id,department, salary,salary-avg(salary) OVER() as salary_vs_average
FROM Emp;


--Calculate the moving average between salaries
SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
avg(salary) OVER(ORDER BY employee ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)as moving_average
FROM Emp;


--Ranking each employee based of their salary in a certain department
SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
RANK() Over(Partition BY department order by salary) as rank_salary_department
FROM Emp


--You want to list the top 3 highest-paid employees in each department along with their salaries.
WITH CTE AS (
