#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


-- Question 1: How many orders were placed in January
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Question 2: How many of those products are Iphones?
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID'
AND product='iPhone';

--Question 3: Select all account numbers in the month of February
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

--Question 4: Which product was the cheapest one sold in January
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--Question 5: Total Revenue for each product sold in January
SELECT sum(quantity)* price as revenue,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Question 6: How many products and total revennue was sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue,product,sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--Question 7: How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum),avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE quantity>2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<> 'Order ID';

--Question 8: Find all the products sold in Los Angeles and how many of each product in February.
SELECT sum(quantity) as amount_products,product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

--Question 1:Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT sum(quantity)as orders_received,location
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%New York%'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING sum(quantity)>=3;

--Question 2:How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
Select sum(quantity) as total_headphones, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%Headphones%'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

--Question 3:What was the average amount spent per account in February? (For this question, we want the average amount spent / 
--number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
SELECT (sum(Feb.quantity*Feb.price)/count(cust.acctnum)) as average_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<> 'Order ID';

--Question 4: What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
--(Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT (sum(Feb.quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)) as average_product_purchased
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<> 'Order ID';

--Question 5: Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product,ROUND(sum(quantity*price),2) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY revenue desc
LIMIT 1;
